Serve - NPM

https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve/v/5.1.0

Ever wanted to share a certain directory on your network by running just a command? Then this module is exactly what you're looking for: It provides a neat interface for listing the directory's contents and switching into sub folders.

In addition, it's also awesome when it comes to serving static sites. If a directory contains an index.html, serve will automatically render it instead of serving directory contents, and will serve any .html file as a rendered page instead of file's content as plaintext.
